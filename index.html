                Mathematical concepts are abstract. "Pure mathematics is on the whole distinctly more useful than applied. For what is useful above all is technique, and mathematical technique is taught mainly through pure mathematics" G. H. Hardy. But the concepts of pure mathematics lead the mathematician to think, to analyze, and to create new inventions. Galois Theory and Hilbert spaces are originally considered as pure mathematics. But now, their concepts are applied widely in the study of quantum theory and other engineering problems. Galois Theory and Hilbert spaces are the best examples for the concept of pure mathematics gradually gaining applications in practical problems. Thus, Mathematics plays a vibrant role in all science and engineering spheres. Hence, the Department of Mathematics aspires to conduct an International Conference on Mathematics and its Applications in Technology (ICMAT 2023). ICMAT 2023 offers platform for the researchers and postgraduate students to share their original research work and will also pave way to interact with the renowned professors and co-researchers in the emerging areas of research in Mathematics and its applications in Information Theory, Network Security, Cryptography, Data Mining, Communication Engineering, Electrical Technology etc.

            <p class="lead">
                A sprawling campus with a vibrant population of students, faculty and state-of-the art laboratories has made SASTRA a landmark in the educational map of India. SASTRA has reached national standing in terms of academic performance, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities and, the development and commitment to social service. SASTRA offers various Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Doctoral Programmes in Engineering, Arts, Science, Law and Management. The excellence of the academic programmes offered by the University is replicated in the ratings awarded by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) which has reaccredited SASTRA with a maximum grade of A++ with score 3.76/4.00 in cycle IV, retaining the status of the Category I University.

            <p class="lead">
                SASTRA established Srinivasa Ramanujan Centre in 2002 as a fitting tribute to the great mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan who spent most of his formative years in the temple town of Kumbakonam. This centre also houses a museum called "House of Ramanujan Mathematics". SASTRA purchased and renovated the house where Srinivasa Ramanujan lived and spent his childhood days. The house and the museum have been dedicated to the nation as an international monument by His Excellency, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the then President of India.

            <p class="lead">
                The prestigious SASTRA-RAMANUJAN Award was instituted in 2005 to honour young mathematicians (age limit of 32) for their outstanding contributions in the area of Mathematics influenced by Srinivasa Ramanujan. The award comprises 10,000 USD and a citation. The award has gained global recognition as one of the top most awards given to mathematicians. Till now 19 mathematicians have received the award. Six among those 19 have gone on to win Fields medal subsequently.

            </div>
            <p class="lead">
                The Department of Mathematics was established in 2002. The Department has 15 faculty members with rich research and teaching experience. The objective of the Department is to encourage, teach and train the students at all levels. Department of Science and Technology established two research chairs one on Number Theory and the other on Discrete Mathematics in 2004. The outcome of the chair resulted in considerable number of publications both at national and international levels and three Ph. D. degrees. The Department has established computer laboratory for Discrete Mathematics under the FIST Programme. The Department is supported by NBHM Library grant. Spacious and well stocked library facility is available with 1521 titles and 2960 books. Since, the campus is Wi-Fi enabled, students can use and download online resources such as journals, thesis, articles and e-books through SASTRA website
